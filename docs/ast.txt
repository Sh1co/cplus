Abstract Syntax Tree for cplus:
===============================

AST node has a type, depending on that type, the other members are defined.

"Program" is an AST node, it contain the list of variables, statements, and routines of the program.
"Variable", "Routine", "IfStatement", "ForLoop", "WhileLoop", etc. are all AST nodes with different data members.


When the parser completely parse an AST node, it crafts such node,
    i.e., create the object with the parsed values and returns a pointer to that object.

For example, when we parse a VariableDeclaration,
    parser should return a pointer to an AST node of type "Variable"
    Variable node basically contain information about the variable,
    i.e., variable identifier and type and initial value if exists.
